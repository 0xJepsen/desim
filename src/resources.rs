//! `Resource` trait and some implementations.
//!
//! In many simulated systems, finite resources have to be taken into account.
//! The `Resource` trait can be used to model such entities.
//!
//! When a resource is added to a simulation with the `create_resource` method an ID is returned.
//! The simulation process can request the resource yielding the `Request` effect with the ID.
//!
//! The `Resource` trait allow the implementation of custom resource types.
//! A `SimpleResource` struct provides a basic but useful implementation of the `Resource` trait.
